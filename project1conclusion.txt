In the final analysis of our project, we examined the locations of fallen and found meteorites, 
the mass of meteorites, and the year in which they were found.

First, we found that the majority of found meteorites fell in the northwestern hemisphere of the world, with a few hot 
spots along coastlines in Antarctica, Australia, Chile, and Oman. The barometric conditions in coastal parts of the
world are likely more conducive to meteorites making contact with earth's surface without exploding.

Second, we found that the recorded numbers of fallen and found meteorites increased significantly after the 1960's,
likely due to the popularity of NASA in the years following the moon landing, as well as progress made in 
scientific tools (satellites, telescopes, etc.) in the following decades making it possible to capture more data
than ever before.

Lastly, we found that the geographic location of fallen and found meteorites has no correlation with the mass of
the object, meaning that heavier and lighter meteorites are not gravitating towards any specific part of the
planet.
