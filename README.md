# project_1

This is Project #1 for Rice University's Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp. Olivia Bedford and Christopher Sharber collaborated to complete and present this project. In this project, we examined a dataframe containing information regarding meteorites that have fallen to earth over the past 2000 years, approximately. 

Our "Resources" folder contains the original dataframe as well as the cleaned version that we worked with. Our individual files (Olivia and Christopher's respective analyses of the dataframe) are contained in the main branch and are labeled with our names. The "Images" folder contains all of the graphs we constructed during our analysis. Our presentation slides are uploaded to the main branch labeled as "Meteorites Fallen to Earth." The conclusions and analysis for our project are contained in the conclusion text file in the main branch.

This code was written in VS Code using Jupyter notebooks files. To run the code properly, please run it in VS Code or in a Jupyter Notebooks browser for best results. 

The work contained herein is ours alone. 

Thank you!
